A Probabilistic Sequencer for Fair Total Ordering


First Experiment:

- Simulate everything to find out the number of batches created by my technique vs a naive technique like
    - true time intervals if overlapping, same batch
    - true time intervlas overlap provides probability then do batching using my algo

- See under several clock drfit distributions what are the resuls of the above
